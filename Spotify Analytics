# For this project, I downloade4d Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL.

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
    ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
    track_name varchar NOT NULL,
    track_id varchar NOT NULL,
    popularity varchar NOT NULL,
    danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
    energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
    key integer NOT NULL,
    loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
    mode integer NOT NULL,
    speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
    acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
    instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
    liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
    valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
    tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
    duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
    time_signature integer NOT NULL);
    
# Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

# Next, I explored the data using the following SQL.

# First I determined the 3 most popular artists based on average popularity of their tracks on the Top 100.
SELECT artist_name, AVG(popularity)
    FROM Spotifydata
    GROUP BY artist_name
    ORDER BY popularity DESC
    LIMIT 3;

# Then I determined what the Top 10 tracks are by popularity.
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
    FROM Spotifydata
    ORDER BY popularity DESC
    LIMIT 10;

# Then I determined which artist released the longest song.
SELECT artist_name, MAX(duration_ms)
    FROM Spotifydata;

# Then I determined the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs.
SELECT track_name, popularity, danceability
    FROM Spotifydata
    WHERE popularity in (SELECT popularity
        FROM Spotifydata
        ORDER BY popularity DESC
        LIMIT 10)
    ORDER BY danceability DESC
    LIMIT 10;
    
# Then I calculated the average popularity for the artists and labeled the ones with an average popularity of 90 or above as a "Top Star".
WITH average_pop_CTE AS(
    SELECT artist_name, AVG(popularity) AS avg_pop
    FROM Spotifydata
    GROUP BY artist_name)
SELECT artist_name, avg_pop, 'Top Star' AS Tag
    FROM average_pop_CTE
    WHERE avg_pop>=90
    ORDER BY avg_pop DESC;
