#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID) FROM JanSales;

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID) FROM JanSales
    WHERE Product='iPhone';
 
#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT customers.acctnum
    FROM customers
    INNER JOIN FebSales
    ON FebSales.orderID=customers.order_id;

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT DISTINCT product, price FROM JanSales
    WHERE price=(SELECT MIN(price) FROM JanSales);

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity)*price AS Revenue
    FROM JanSales
    GROUP BY Product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity), SUM(Quantity)*price AS Revenue
    FROM FebSales
    WHERE location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
    GROUP BY Product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(customers.acctnum), AVG(Quantity*price)
    FROM FebSales
    LEFT JOIN customers
    ON FebSales.orderID=customers.order_id
    WHERE Quantity>2;
