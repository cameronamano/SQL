# For this project, I compiled movie star data from Google.
# Then I created 3 tables to insert movie star data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL.

# Creating the actors table:
CREATE TABLE actors (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT);
   # Inserting movie star names into the table:
   INSERT INTO actors (name)
        VALUES ("Blake Lively");
    INSERT INTO actors (name)
        VALUES ("Ryan Reynolds");
    INSERT INTO actors (name)
        VALUES ("Eva Mendes");    
    INSERT INTO actors (name)
        VALUES ("Ryan Gosling");
    INSERT INTO actors (name)
        VALUES ("Kristen Bell");
    INSERT INTO actors (name)
        VALUES ("Dax Shepard");
# Creating the spouses table:
CREATE TABLE spouses (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    actor1_id INTEGER,
    actor2_id INTEGER);
   # Inserting spouse IDs into the table:
   INSERT INTO spouses (actor1_id, actor2_id)
        VALUES (1, 2);    
    INSERT INTO spouses (actor1_id, actor2_id)
        VALUES (3, 4);  
    INSERT INTO spouses (actor1_id, actor2_id)
        VALUES (5, 6);    
# Creating the movies table:
CREATE TABLE movies (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    actor_id INTEGER,
    movie_title TEXT);
    # Inserting the movie list into the table:
    INSERT INTO movies (actor_id, movie_title)
        VALUES (1, "The Age of Adeline");
    INSERT INTO movies (actor_id, movie_title)
        VALUES (1, "A Simple Favor"); 
    INSERT INTO movies (actor_id, movie_title)
        VALUES (1, "The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants");
    INSERT INTO movies (actor_id, movie_title)
        VALUES (2, "Free Guy");    
    INSERT INTO movies (actor_id, movie_title)
        VALUES (2, "Deadpool");
    INSERT INTO movies (actor_id, movie_title)
        VALUES (2, "The Proposal");     
    INSERT INTO movies (actor_id, movie_title)
        VALUES (3, "Hitch");    
    INSERT INTO movies (actor_id, movie_title)
        VALUES (3, "Ghost Rider");
    INSERT INTO movies (actor_id, movie_title)
        VALUES (3, "2 Fast 2 Furious");   
    INSERT INTO movies (actor_id, movie_title)
        VALUES (4, "La La Land");  
    INSERT INTO movies (actor_id, movie_title)
        VALUES (4, "Crazy, Stupid, Love"); 
    INSERT INTO movies (actor_id, movie_title)
        VALUES (4, "The Notebook"); 
    INSERT INTO movies (actor_id, movie_title)
        VALUES (5, "Frozen");
    INSERT INTO movies (actor_id, movie_title)
        VALUES (5, "Frozen 2");    
    INSERT INTO movies (actor_id, movie_title)
        VALUES (5, "When in Rome");
    INSERT INTO movies (actor_id, movie_title)
        VALUES (6, "Zathura");
    INSERT INTO movies (actor_id, movie_title)
        VALUES (6, "Cheaper by the Dozen");
    INSERT INTO movies (actor_id, movie_title)
        VALUES (6, "Baby Mama");

# Next, I explored the data using the following SQL.
SELECT * FROM actors;
SELECT * FROM spouses;
SELECT * FROM movies;

/*Which actors are in which movies?*/
SELECT name, movie_title
    FROM movies
    JOIN actors
    ON movies.actor_id = actors.id;
    
/*Which actors are married to each other?*/
SELECT a.name, b.name
    FROM spouses
    JOIN actors a
    ON spouses.actor1_id = a.id
    JOIN actors b
    ON spouses.actor2_id = b.id;
